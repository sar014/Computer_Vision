# Computer Vision Tasks

For Yolo, Harris Corner Detection (video question),Video Analytics and Traffic Monitoring you need to download any open source video for testing purpose. 


### Traffic Monitoring
Developed a YOLO-based video analytics system capable of vehicle detection, tracking, speed estimation, congestion analysis, and stopped-vehicle identification from traffic footage.

### Video Analytics
Built a YOLO-powered retail video analytics solution for people counting, congestion detection, and queue estimation to analyze customer behavior and store traffic patterns.

### Yolo
Learned object detection fundamentals by combining classification and localization, applied a modern YOLO model for real-time detection, and understood the distinctions between classification, detection, and segmentation.

### Xerox JBIG2 Error
Tasks implemnted include:
1. Extract connected components, measure shape similarity, group similar symbols, and replace with a prototype.
2. Adjust similarity threshold to observe when different characters start merging.
3. Generate multiple compressed versions, compute PSNR/SSIM, and analyze edge detection or OCR outputs.
4. Extract components/contours and quantify structural differences to detect distortions or substitutions.
5. Recognize characters using heuristics and measure accuracy on original vs compressed images.
6. Use image features like entropy, edge density, or component count to decide between lossless, lossy, or no compression.

### Harris Corner Detection
Optimize corner detection by using efficient filtering, tunable non-maximum suppression, adaptive thresholding, sub-pixel accuracy, multi-scale Harris detection, top-N score selection, and score-based FAST suppression.

### SIFT, SURF and ORB
Implemented SURF, ORB, and SIFT feature detectors and descriptors for matching keypoints between two images, using BFMatcher with Lowe’s ratio test for reliable correspondences, and visualized the results with drawMatches.

### Semantic Segmentation 
Implemented and trained a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation on the Carvana Image Masking Challenge dataset, enabling accurate pixel-level identification of vehicle regions.

### LAB1 - CNN
Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, designing convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to learn feature representations and classify images into 10 categories, and trained the model using Python and Keras/TensorFlow.

### LAB1 - Transfer Learning
Applied transfer learning using the ResNet50 architecture, leveraging pre-trained weights to extract features and fine-tuning the network for a custom image classification task, enabling faster convergence and improved accuracy on the target dataset.
